  <p class="paragraph"> My Name Is Dominik</p>
  <p class="about">I am currently studying Computer Softwaree Engineering at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology. I am learning the basics of web development and I hope to soon take it to the next level and be able to make and design a full
    website using HTML, CSS, and Java Script. As you navigate throughout the nav bar at the top you will be able to see some of the projects that I have completed so far. If you have any questions or comments for me just click the contact panel and
    let me know. Thanks for coming to my website and I hope you enjoy your stay!</p>
